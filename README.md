# Overwatch-Aimbot

Before Blizzard bans me, I've got to say that this was just an experiment I run for the science. The fact that I choose Overwatch is because I love it, and it somehow motivated me to do this. I want to make clear that this can't be used in any playmode apart from combat training, that's where I've done all the testing.

Said this, this project is still unfinished. For now it detects enemies near the point you are looking to and auto aims whenever the left button is pressed. And it works moreless ( I haven't spent many with to this). Plenty of improvements can be done. For example, the enemy detection is just a simple tracking by colour (the red contour that all enemies have) and, although it works fine, it could be combined with more complex techniques (maybe involving machine learning) for being more accurate in detection. Apart from that, the control is very poor and artifficial, It would be fine to develop an smoother and more effective aim.

Once again, if you are from Blizzard, I'm sorry :)
